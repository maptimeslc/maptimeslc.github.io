We will gather at [Joffee's Coffees](http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2641243050#map=17/40.72406/-111.86021) this Saturday at 2PM. Come out and map the world!

If you have never edited OpenStreetMap before, come and learn! Bring your laptop and a mouse if you have one. If you want, you can [sign up for OpenStreetMap](http://osm.org/user/new) now and start looking around. 

Here's a great video that will show you the basics of editing OpenStreetMap. It is by the [MapGive](http://mapgive.state.gov/) campaign and aimed at mapping for humanitarian causes, but even if you want to edit the map right here in Utah, this video has good instructions.
