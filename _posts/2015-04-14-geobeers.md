title: Join OpenStreetMap and Maptime SLC for $geobeers
---

Hi Maptimers! We wanted to let you know that there's a monthly #geobeers event hosted by our friends from the local Salt Lake OpenStreetMap group. It's at the Bayou on State Street in Salt Lake City, on every second Tuesday of the month from 6pm onwards. Just stop by and say hi, or RSVP at the [Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/openstreetmap-slc/events/221102550/). There will be an orange OpenStreetMap surveyor's vest so you know where to look for the #geobeers crowd. See you there?
