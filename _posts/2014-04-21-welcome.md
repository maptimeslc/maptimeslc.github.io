Hello there map lovers! 

This is Maptime SLC, a new place for everyone who loves maps and wants to learn - or teach! - map making in the digital age. 

We will be **getting together once a month** to work on mappy projects, and that can mean whatever you want it to mean! Do you want to master the Javascript you need to create a web map? Do you want to learn how to design maps with Tilemill? Do you want to contribute to OpenStreetMap? Start using the vast amount of open geodata out there?

You have found your group. Join us at our next event! Watch this space for announcements, and follow [https://twitter.com/MaptimeSLC](@maptimeslc) on Twitter!
